{bin} {version}
{description}

Select the version to use in this shell session.
This command requires `fzf` to be installed!

USAGE:
    {bin} [use] [QUERY] [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -v, --verbose    Prints more information on stderr
    -h, --help       Prints this help information on stderr

ARGS:
    <QUERY>    Optional query to start a selection.

This is the default command and can be left out.

    {bin} [QUERY]        and
    {bin} use [QUERY]    are identical

If `use` is ommited, the optional query must not match any other commands,
lest that command is run. If QUERY is missing, all available candidates will
be offered for selection via fzf. If QUERY can only lead to a single
selection, that option will be chosen immediately with any selection. In that
case, fzf is still required (the --select1 option is passed).

`fzf` (https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is required for this command. The
binary will be searched in the $PATH environment variable. If the variable
$JDKMAN_FZF is set, that value will be used instead.

With the current environment, the following fzf will be used:
{fzf_bin}

Upon successful execution, {bin} prints shell code to stdout that needs to be
evaluated in order to provide all the functionality, e.g. with
`jdk () {{ $({bin} "$*") }}`.

All informational messages are printed to stderr, even if they are not
necessarily an error. This is done so that stdout can always be `eval`-ed.
