    <VERSION>        Candidate version to isntall


This command will always install a remote candidate. To link a locally 
available version, use `{bin} link <FOLDER> <CANDIDATE>`.

Using `-d, --set-default` has the same effect as calling
`{bin} default <VERSION>` after this command.
Using `-u, --use` has the same effect as calling
`{bin} use <VERSION>` after this command.

If `--suggested` is given, the <CANDIDATE> can be empty and will be ignored.

To see which versions are available for installation, use `{bin} list --all`.
