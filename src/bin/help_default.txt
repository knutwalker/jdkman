ARGS:
    <QUERY>    Optional query to start a selection.

If QUERY is missing, all available candidates will be offered for selection via
fzf. If QUERY can only lead to a single selection, that option will be chosen
immediately with any selection. In that case, fzf is still required (the
--select1 option is passed).

`fzf` (https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is required for this command. The
binary will be searched in the $PATH environment variable. If the variable
$JDKMAN_FZF is set, that value will be used instead.

With the current environment, the following fzf will be used:
{fzf_bin}
