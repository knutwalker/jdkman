OPTIONS:
    -a, --all        List all available versions

The default behavior for {bin} list is to operate completely offline.
Infact, the listed versions will be identical to those listed by `{bin} use`.

If `--all` is given, jdkman will hit the sdkman servers and query for all
available versions. This behavior mirrors the default behavior of `sdk list`.
